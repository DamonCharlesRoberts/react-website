# AAPOR 2025

AAPOR is the American Association of Public Opinion Research and is an organization
full of election pollsters, federal statisticians and academics who care about the
field of how we can best gather and summarize how the public feels. It is an
important organization full of people who care about giving voice to 
the people. This group of passionate people meet every year to share what they
have been doing to try to get better at how to do this as an industry. This exercise
has become even more important in the last decade or so given some of the very public
misses that members of this community have made about forecasting. I take some issue
with the whole of the public opinion industry falling on the sword for this because
I believe there is a distinction that needs to be more clearly made between forecasting
with horse-race polling and public opinion research. However, I will lay that aside for
a different time.

The point of this post is for me to share my reflections about this year's particular
meeting that happened in St. Louis. I unfortunately was not able to attend all sessions
or am aware of all of the great work that people presented on. From my experience, the
two common threads were: (1) how can we use generative AI to help public opinion researchers
be more efficient from an analysis and data collection stand point or to be more
statistically efficient by using synthetic or silicon data to augment real data collected
from (presumably) real people; (2) and how can we deal with the pernicious problem of certain
groups in the public being very unwilling to share their beliefs to public opinion researchers.
I tended to attend panels that were more focused on the latter so my focus will largely be
on what I learned from panels on that topic.         

For the past decade or so, a common theme has been emerging in public opinion research:
Trump supporters have been harder to get into our datasets than other members of the population.
This is a problem as it means that our datasets are underrepresenting the viewpoints of Trump
supporters. The results of this has been quite public for the past decade or so with many, including
Trump, arguing that polls and other forms of public opinion research is biased against Trump.
This "bias" is largely not the result of an active desire to have our datasets underrepresent
Trump supporters out of any nefarious desire to suppress those voices. The reality is
that this is actually the opposite. In almost each panel that I attended, there was a very
clear message that public opinion researchers are wanting to solve this problem. However, there
are tremendous challenges. The key problem that public opinion researchers are desperate to solve
is how to reach those who voted for Trump but who generally prefer to avoid the nastiness of 
the current political climate.
